# Hi there! I'm Abimbola Akala 👋

**Founder & Lead Architect @ Kini | Product Manager @ Workday | AI/ML Discovery Strategist**

pronounced: Ah-bim-ball-ah    |    pronouns: she/her

I am a cinephile and tech-geek obsessed with solving the "discovery paradox." I believe that finding the perfect movie shouldn't be a chore—it should be part of the magic. My passion for cinema and deep learning led me to build **Kini**, an autonomous discovery engine designed to understand the "soul" of content through high-dimensional data.

Currently, I balance my time between scaling **Kini** and leading AI/ML talent matching strategy at **Workday**, where I manage dual Scrum teams and deliver high-impact global features.

## 🧬 Featured Project: Kini — The AI-Powered Entertainment Discovery App

**Kini** is more than a watchlist; it’s a sophisticated recommendation architecture built to achieve a **45-second "Decision to Play"** target. It moves beyond traditional genre tags to capture the specific artistic DNA of over 50k films.

### 🧠 The Kini Brain: Architecture Highlights


* **The Cinephile DNA™:** A proprietary 12-metric rubric that scores films on continuous scales, including **Narrative Complexity**, **Pacing**, **Arousal Level**, and **Thematic Depth**.

* **Vector Search & Latent Space:** Utilizing mathematical vector queries to find nearest-neighbor matches in high-dimensional DNA space for sub-500ms recommendation delivery.

* **Explainable AI:** Every recommendation is backed by a "Micro-Reason" (e.g., *"A rare slow-burn with high character depth"*) to build immediate user trust.

* **Reinforcement Learning Loop:** A feedback system that adjusts user preference profiles based on high-intent signals like "Watchlist Additions" and "Dismissals".

### 🎨 Modern, Clean UI

Kini features a dark, minimalist aesthetic focused on "Mood-Inspired Discovery". Users can select "vibes" (e.g., Cerebral, Twisted, Heartfelt) or use natural language prompts to navigate the library effortlessly.
